# Electronic Address Book

This repository contains an electronic address book built using HTML, CSS, and JS with object manipulation and local storage functionality. The application allows users to add, and stores the contact information locally in the browser.

## How to use the application

The application includes two buttons: one to add a new contact and another to search for a specific contact. To add a new contact, click the "Add Contact" button and fill in the corresponding fields.

The contact information is automatically saved to the browser's local storage, allowing it to be accessed even after closing the application or browser.

To delete or edit a contact, click the corresponding buttons in the contact's row. Editing a contact allows users to modify the contact's name, last name, phone number, and interests, and also allows them to add a new profile picture.

To search for a contact, click the "Search" button and enter the name of the desired contact. The application will display the contact's information if it exists in the local storage.
